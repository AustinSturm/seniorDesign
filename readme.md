# Senior Design Project

This is the remnants of my senior design project, this was a snapshot of development and I cant find the finished development. The goal was to create a hardware device that supported two 170 degree camera interfaces. That would stream and alert on potential break-ins and detect unauthorized drives in the vehicle. There was a mobile aspect, a hardware aspect and then a web aspect for storage and management of a users device.
